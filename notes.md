# NOTES ABOUT THE DATA

### 03/03 (Fri)
- Q190: missing data depends on the value of Q189 (missing by design)
	- Q190_1 to Q190_6 use 7 as planned missing value
	- Q190_8 to Q190_10 use 97 as planned missing value
- when there is missing data in a supposedly ordinal encoded column, the integers are actually strings, not integers

### 02/24 (Fri)
- all the necessary metadata and documentation are in the DS0005 → don't really need the other two (DS0001 and DS0003)
- ...User_guide.pdf ← one should start here
- ...Codebook...pdf is summary statistics of each column/variable
	- "Location" is about the size of the data (which range of digits it corresponds to)
- ...Documentation-MULTI.pdf is the combined transgender and cisgender variables
- ...Questionnaire...pdf is the actual survey given to study participants
	- the first table divides the questions based on the "Construct" or theme ("Identity", "Transition", "Healthcare Access & Utilization", etc.) → may be helpful in narrowing down specific questions
- [ ] look into what this dataset has been used for whether in research, politics or activism
